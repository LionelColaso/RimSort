Steamworks API Wrapper Module

Provides Python wrappers for Steamworks API interactions including:
- Workshop mod subscription/unsubscription (ISteamUGC)
- Game launching with Steamworks integration
- App dependency queries
- Callback-based async event handling

Key features:
- Proper sequencing for resubscribe operations (unsub → 1s wait → sub → 1s wait → download)
- Batched processing with operation intervals (0.1s) for subscribe/unsubscribe
- Time-based completion waiting (callbacks unreliable for batch operations)
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

Usage:
    - SteamworksSubscriptionHandler: Handle mod subscription operations
    - SteamworksGameLaunch: Launch RimWorld with Steamworks initialized
    - SteamworksAppDependenciesQuery: Query mod dependencies

    Resubscribe timing is critical for fixing GitHub issue #1460 (missing mods):
    1. UnsubscribeItem() → Steam marks as unsubscribed

    5. DownloadItem(high_priority=True) → Forces Steam to prioritize re-download

        Stage 2: Wait 1 second (let Steam uninstall all mod files)
        Stage 3: Subscribe ALL mods (small delays between API calls)
        Stage 4: Wait 1 second (let Steam register all subscriptions)

        This batched approach is more efficient than per-mod sequencing:
        - Faster: Reduces total time from 27+ seconds (per-mod) to ~4 seconds (batched)
        - More stable: All unsubs complete before any subs start
        - Clearer: Better matches Steam's async queue expectations

        Without proper staging, Steam may queue subscribe before unsubscribe
        completes, resulting in mods subscribed but not downloaded.
